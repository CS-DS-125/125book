What is Data Science?
---------------------

Data Science is a field that focuses on the specific problems of acquiring, curating, and exploring data, via visualization and statistical analysis, to aid decision making.

Acquiring data typically involves either accessing or creating data sets. Accessing data might involve retrieving data from different kinds of data repositories that have been developed by companies, government agencies, or academic researchers. Creating your own data sets might involve any activity where you collect your own data. Data Science provides many tools for generating data through automation by using information sources on the internet. For example, we could generate a data set about jobs in a particular area by collecting information from job posting websites.  

Curating data typically involves cleaning and organizing data sets in preparation for analysis and visualization. Real-world data sets often contain missings data, erroneous information, and duplicate entries. Data Science provides methods and tools for finding and correcting these problems. If data is being integrated from multiple separate datasets, data science also provide methods and tools for properly merging different sources of data.  

Large data sets are difficult for people to understand in their raw form. Visualizations and statistics are two tools that help us understand large data sets. Visualizations refer to graphical representations of data, like charts or figures. Statistics are formal mathematical tools for helping us describe and make inferences from large sets of data. Data Science provides tools that allow for the automation of the creation of visualizations and statistics.   

Data scientists typically apply programming along with mathematics and applied statistics to problems within a specific domain area (for example, finance or meterology). Knowing how and when to use data science tools requires expertise in the domain area where the tools are being used. 

It is important to remember that data science tools only provide useful insights if the right data and the right tools are being used to solve the problem. It is easy to produce results that look important or insightful but might actually be misleading.

What Skills Do I Need to Do Data Science?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You will need to know programming. You will need to know statistics. You will need to know about your domain area. Data Scientists do differ quite a bit in how much they know about or use knoweldge in these three areas. Some are stronger in programming and statistics but not domain knowledge, others may be strong in programming and domain knowledge but not know about or need much statistics. However, one thing that differentiates a Data Scientist from a traditional programmer, a traditional statistician, and a traditional business analyst, is the degree to which the Data Scientist can use tools from each of these areas to solve problems. 

Another common skill that is required for Data Scientists is communication. Great solutions to problems are only really great solutions if you can convince other people that they work. Knowing how to convey technical information about a solution to an audience that does not share your technical expertise is a great challenge. 


Some Examples of Data that Might be Used in Data Science
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Structured data such as databases or spreasheets. 

Unstructured data such as e-mails, tweets, pictures, or videos. 

Natural langugage data refers to data in the form of human language (written or spoken).
