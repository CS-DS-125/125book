Functions
=========

We've seen a lot of code by now that makes use of **functions**.  ``print()``,
``len()``, ``input()``, and just about anything else we've written with
parentheses ``(`` ``)`` after a name -- these have all been functions.  So,
intuitively, you probably have a sense that when we write one of these function
names in our code, we are telling the computer to *do* whatever it is that the
given function does.

There's always more detail underneath, though, and now is a good time to learn
about the details of functions.
