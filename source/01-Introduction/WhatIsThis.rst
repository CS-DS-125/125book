What is This?
-------------

If you're starting into this book -- and probably starting into a course that
uses it -- then you might not have a clear idea of what it is all about.  You
look at the title, and you have some idea of what "computer science" and "data
science" might be just from their names, but it might not be clear what Python and 
Pandas have to do with anything.  To begin our exploration of all of these
things, it would probably help to have a high-level overview.

So let's try to sum up the whole book in one sentence:

.. admonition:: This book in one sentence

   This book aims to teach you how to solve problems with computers by
   programming them, with an emphasis on solving problems with and learning
   from data.

Each piece of the book title ties into that sentence:

* **Python** is the language we will use to *program computers*.
* **Pandas** is a powerful tool we will use with Python to manipulate *data*.
* **Computer Science** is all about *solving problems with computers*.
* **Data Science** involves *solving problems with and learning from data*.

So why is this our aim? Why are these things worth studying?  What can you do with 
the knowledge you will gain reading this book? The long answer to those questions will
be found as you work through the concepts in this book and see what you can accomplish.
A short answer is: 

.. admonition:: Why study this?

   1. Computers are incredibly powerful.
   2. There is data everywhere, in increasing quantities and pervading all aspects
   of our lives.
   3. The ability to direct computers to solve problems with data is a valuable
   skill in any area(s) of interest you might have -- and it's often fun!

The main focus of this book will be on developing that ability, programming,
and its application to data.  First, though, we will introduce you to some key concepts
and ideas.
