## An Introduction to Computer and Data Science
### *aka [https://snakebear.science/](https://snakebear.science)*

From the Introduction:

> This book aims to teach you how to solve problems with computers by programming them, with an emphasis on solving problems with and learning from data.

In other words: Python, Pandas, Programming, and some Data Science.

It's intended for use in an introductory university-level course on Computer and Data Science with no prerequisites.  See [https://github.com/CS-DS-125](https://github.com/CS-DS-125) for other repositories with related course materials.

## Authors

This book was developed by Mark Liffiton and Brad Sheese, building on the excellent open-source *[Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book)* and in turn on the open-source books from which it was derived.

## Building

Requires a [fork of RunestoneComponents](https://github.com/liffiton/RunestoneComponents/tree/mine).
Install that with `pip install -e .` in the `RunestoneComponents` directory.
Then `pip -r requirements.txt` in the book directory.
Finally, `make` should build everything.
