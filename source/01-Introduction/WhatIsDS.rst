What is Data Science?
---------------------

Data Science is a field that focuses on the specific problems of acquiring, curating, and exploring data, via visualization and statistical analysis, to aid decision making.

Acquiring data typically involves either accessing or creating data sets. Accessing data might involve retrieving data from different kinds of data repositories that have been developed by companies, government agencies, or academic researchers. Creating data sets might involve writing programs to collect data from websites or apps.  

Curating data typically involves cleaning and organizing data sets in preparation for analysis and visualization. Real-world data sets often contain missings data, erroneous information, and duplicate entries. Data Science provides methods and tools for finding and addressing these types of problems. If data is being integrated from multiple separate datasets, data science also provide methods and tools for properly merging different sources of data.  

Large data sets are difficult for people to understand in their raw form. Visualizations and statistics are two tools that help us understand large data sets. Visualizations refer to graphical representations of data, like charts or figures. Statistics are formal mathematical tools for helping us describe and make inferences from large sets of data.  

Data scientists typically apply programming along with mathematics and applied statistics to problems within a specific content area. Knowing how and when to deploy data science tools requires expertise in the content area where the tools are being deployed. It is important to remember that data science tools only provide useful insights if the right tool is being used to for the problem at hand.
