Strings, Lists, and Files (Multiple Pieces of Data)
===================================================

If we want to do data science, we'll need tools to deal with many pieces of
data at once.  Data often enters the data science workflow in one or more
files.  From there we read it into strings, then usually break it up into
separate values using lists.  All of these are tools for working with multiple
pieces of data; we'll even see that a string is really multiple pieces of data
(the individual characters) stored together in one place.
