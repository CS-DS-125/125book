Preface for "Think Python"

The strange history of "Think Python"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Allen B. Downey)

In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming
class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated.
The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who
succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.

One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too
much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance
about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect:
they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around
Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new
material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking
up the pieces.

Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own
book. My goals were:

-  Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not
   read 50 pages.

-  Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define
   each term at first use.

-  Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult
   topics and split them into a series of small steps.

-  Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the
   minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.

I needed a title, so on a whim I chose *How to Think Like a Computer
Scientist*.

My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and
they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics,
the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students
practice.

I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which
allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.

What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher
in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a
copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning
Python by reading my own book.

Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers,
and in 2001 we released *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist:
Learning with Python*, also under the GNU Free Documentation License. As
Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling hard copies
through Amazon.com and college book stores. Other books from Green Tea
Press are available at `greenteapress.com <greenteapress.com>`__.

In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for
the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled
less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally
had a lot more fun.

Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book,
correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material,
especially exercises. In 2008 I started work on a major revision—at the
same time, I was contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press
who was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!

I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to
program and think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.

Acknowledgements for "Think Python"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Allen B. Downey)

First and most importantly, I thank Jeff Elkner, who translated my Java
book into Python, which got this project started and introduced me to
what has turned out to be my favorite language.

I also thank Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections to *How to
Think Like a Computer Scientist*.

And I thank the Free Software Foundation for developing the GNU Free
Documentation License, which helped make my collaboration with Jeff and
Chris possible.

I also thank the editors at Lulu who worked on *How to Think Like a
Computer Scientist*.

I thank all the students who worked with earlier versions of this book
and all the contributors (listed in an Appendix) who sent in corrections
and suggestions.

And I thank my wife, Lisa, for her work on this book, and Green Tea
Press, and everything else, too.
