Values and Data Types
---------------------

Computers are very fast and very precise, but they don't understand things the
way humans do. Humans know that a square root can be applied to 92 but not to our cat.  
Your computer doesn't have any categories at all built in, so humans have to help,
so our interactions with computers are less likely to produce nonsense. 

Any information we give to a program is called **data**. Data that is used by a program
is almost always classified into a **data type**. 

'Cat' is text information. The text data type is called **string**. In Python strings
are always enclosed in quotations marks, like this: 'cat', or this "cat", and sometimes
even this '''cat'''.

93 is numeric information. There are a few different numeric data types. This particular
example's data type would be **integer**. 

By classifying 'Cat' as a string and 93 as an integer, we have told the computer that
certain kinds of actions (what we will call 'operations') make sense with one but not
with the other. For example, if we try to divide two strings we get an error.

.. activecode:: types01

    cat = 'cat'
    dog = 'dog'
    cat/dog
    
It we change the data type of cat and dog to something appropriate for division,
Python will return a result. 

.. activecode:: types02

    cat = 81
    dog = 9
    cat/dog

In programming we will often use the word **value**, rather than data or datum,
to talk about a specific piece of information that a program works with.

The values we have worked with so far include ``'cat'``, ``'dog'``, ``81``,
and ``9``.  

If you are not sure what the type of a particular value is, the ``type()``
function can tell you:

.. activecode:: types03

   print('The type of "Hello, World!" is:')
   print(type("Hello, World!"))
   print('The type of 17 is:')
   print(type(17))

   # Try writing a line of code to find the type of 123.45

Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type ``str`` and integers belong
to the type ``int``.  Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a
type called ``float``, because these numbers are stored in the computer in a
format called *floating point*.

.. activecode:: types04

   print('The type of 123.45 is:')
   print(type(123.45))

What about values like ``"17"`` and ``"123.45"``? They look like numbers, but they
are in quotation marks like strings.

.. activecode:: types05

   print('The type of "17" is:')
   print(type("17"))
   print('The type of "123.45" is:')
   print(type("123.45"))

They‚Äôre strings!  It's important to understand and remember that ``"17"`` and
``17`` are *very* different things to Python.

Strings
^^^^^^^

Python is using quotation marks to figure out what is a string and what is not.
What happens when we want to use a quotation mark as part of a string? Any
contraction, like I'm, or possessive, like her's, included in a string would
would cause Python to think the string had ended. We can get around this by
starting and ending a string with different types of quotation marks.

Strings enclosed in one kind of quote symbol can *contain* the other kind.
For example single quotations ``'`` can be wrapped in double ``"`` and
double ``"`` can be wrapped in single.

.. activecode:: strings01

   print("This is a string.")
   print('This is also a string.')
   print("I'm okay with this string's apostrophes.")
   print('And this string quotes the earlier, "This is a string."')

What do you think will happen if a string contains a quotation mark of the same
kind that encloses it?

.. activecode:: strings02
    :nocanvas:

    print('What happens in 'this' case?')

There is a syntax error because the quotation mark that we want to be inside
the string actually ends the string, and then the rest of the line is invalid
Python syntax. See if you can get the code above to work by changing the 
type of quotation marks used.

.. index::
   single: string; escaping

There is another way to fix this issue. To put a quote character inside a string
that is the same as the one used to start and end the string, the character 
can be **escaped** by putting a backslash ``\`` in front of it, as in ``"The string
\"four\" is four characters long."``.

.. activecode:: strings03
    :nocanvas:

    print('Okay, so \'this\' works.')

Escaping with backslashes is used in many instances when we want Python to read
something as text, not just with quotation marks.

And by the way: since strings are sequences of characters, and emoji are
just sequences of characters...

.. activecode:: strings04

   print('My password is ‚úìüêéüîã‚úÇüòï')


Numbers
^^^^^^^

When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between
groups of three digits, as in 1,000,000. This is not a valid *integer* in
Python, but it is valid syntax:

.. activecode:: numbers01

   print(1,000,000)

Well, that‚Äôs not what we expected at all! Python interprets ``1,000,000`` as a
three comma-separated integers, which it prints with spaces between.

.. note::

   The ``print()`` function will print as many different values as you give it,
   as long as they are separated by commas.  The values will be separated by
   spaces in the output.

   For example:

   ::

      >>> print("Hello, World!", 1, 2, 123.45)
      Hello, World! 1 2 123.45

.. index:: semantic error, error message
   single: error; semantic

This is the first example we have seen of a **semantic error**: the code is
*syntactically* valid and runs without producing an error message, but it
doesn‚Äôt do what *thought* or *wanted* it to do.  In this case, Python's rule
about what commas mean doesn't exactly match what we might assume about them
based on using commas in everyday writing.

.. caution::

   Programming languages are formal languages with strict, precise rules about
   what is valid code and what that code means.  The computer will do exactly
   what you tell it to do... so be careful about what you tell it to do!

Type Conversion Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often data is in one form and we need it in another.  For example, if a data
set is stored in a text format, every value will be stored as a string even if
they are really numeric data.  Python provides a few **type conversion**
functions that will *attempt* to convert data from one type into another.  Each
of the three data types we've seen so far has a matching function that converts
into that type:

- ``int()``
- ``float()``
- ``str()``

The ``int()`` function can convert a floating point number or a string into an
int.  When given a floating point number, it *discards* the decimal portion of
the number, called *truncation towards zero* on the number line.  For example:

.. activecode:: typeconv01

    print("Printing values of different types & their conversion to ints.")
    print('The float', 3.0, 'converts to', int(3.0))
    print('The float', 3.14, 'converts to', int(3.14))
    print('The float', 3.9999, 'converts to', int(3.9999))   # This does *not* round to the closest int!
    print('The float', -3.999,  'converts to', int(-3.999))   # Note that the result is closer to zero
    print('The string','"2345"',  'converts to',  int("2345")) # a string can produce an int

Python won't always succeed in converting from one data type to another.

.. activecode:: typeconv02
    # What will this do?
    print('"23bottles"', int("23bottles"))

The error shows that a string given to ``int()`` has to 
be a syntactically valid integer.  Anything else will cause an error.

The ``float()`` function converts an integer, float, or syntactically valid
string into a float.

.. activecode:: typeconv03
    :nocanvas:

    print("Printing values of different types & their conversion to floats.")
    print('The integer',123, float(123))
    print('The string','"123"', float("123"))
    print('The string','"123.45"', float("123.45"))
    print('The float',123.45, float(123.45))

And finally, ``str()`` can convert just about anything into a string.  The
applications of this are a bit less common, but it's worth remembering it
exists.

      For each type conversion function call, write the value it will produce to the right.

      ``int(1234)``: |blank|

      ``int(8.8)``: |blank|

      -   :1234.0: Correct.
          :1234: Almost, but written that way it is an integer.  Floats are always written with a decimal point and a digit after it, even if the digit is just 0.
