What is Data Science?
---------------------

Data Science is a field that focuses on the specific problems of acquiring, curating, and exploring data, via visualization and statistical analysis, to aid decision making.

Acquiring data typically involves either accessing or creating data sets. Accessing data might involve retrieving data from different kinds of data repositories that have been developed by companies, government agencies, or academic researchers. Creating data sets might involve writing programs to collect data from websites or apps.  

Curating data typically involves cleaning and organizing data sets in preparation for analysis and visualization. Real-world data sets often contain missings data, erroneous information, and duplicate entries. Data Science provides methods and tools for finding and addressing these types of problems. If data is being integrated from multiple separate datasets, data science also provide methods and tools for properly merging different sources of data.  

Large data sets are difficult for people to understand in their raw form. Visualizations and statistics are two tools that help us understand large data sets. Visualizations refer to graphical representations of data, like charts or figures. Statistics are formal mathematical tools for helping us describe and make inferences from large sets of data.  

Data scientists typically apply programming along with mathematics and applied statistics to problems within a specific content area (such as finance, or meterology). Knowing how and when to use data science tools requires expertise in the content area where the tools are being used. 

It is important to remember that data science tools only provide useful insights if the right data and the right tools are being used to solve the problem. It is easy to produce results that look important or insightful but might actually be misleading.  

What Do I Need to Do to Do Data Science?
----------------------------------------
You will need to know programming. You will need to know statistics. You will need to know about your content area. 


Some Examples of Data that Might be Used in Data Science
--------------------------------------------------------
Structured data such as databases or spreasheets. 

Unstructured data such as e-mails, tweets, pictures, or videos. 

Natural langugage refers to data in the form of human language (written or spoken).
