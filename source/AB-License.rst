**Additional licensing note from Charles Severance:**

    I would have preferred to license the book under the less restrictive
    CC-BY-SA license. But unfortunately there are a few unscrupulous
    organizations who search for and find freely licensed books, and then
    publish and sell virtually unchanged copies of the books on a print on
    demand service such as LuLu or CreateSpace. CreateSpace has (thankfully)
    added a policy that gives the wishes of the actual copyright holder
    preference over a non-copyright holder attempting to publish a freely
    licensed work. Unfortunately there are many print-on-demand services and
    very few have as well-considered a policy as CreateSpace.

    Regretfully, I added the NC element to the license this book to give me
    recourse in case someone tries to clone this book and sell it
    commercially. Unfortunately, adding NC limits uses of this material that
    I would like to permit. So I have added this section of the document to
    describe specific situations where I am giving my permission in advance
    to use the material in this book in situations that some might consider
    commercial.

    -  If you are printing a limited number of copies of all or part of this
       book for use in a course (e.g., like a coursepack), then you are granted
       CC-BY license to these materials for that purpose.

    -  If you are a teacher at a university and you translate this book into a
       language other than English and teach using the translated book, then
       you can contact me and I will granted you a CC-BY-SA license to these
       materials with respect to the publication of your translation.  In
       particular, you will be permitted to sell the resulting translated book
       commercially.

    If you are intending to translate the book, you may want to contact me
    so we can make sure that you have all of the related course materials so
    you can translate them as well.

    Of course, you are welcome to contact me and ask for permission if these
    clauses are not sufficient. In all cases, permission to reuse and remix
    this material will be granted as long as there is clear added value or
    benefit to students or teachers that will accrue as a result of the new
    work.
