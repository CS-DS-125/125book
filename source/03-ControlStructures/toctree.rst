Control Structures
==================

In some of the sample programs so far, you've seen keywords like ``for`` and
``if`` that we haven't explained yet.  You might have gleaned some idea of
their meaning already by carefully considering how they might produce the
program outputs you saw.  These keywords, along with ``while``, are known as
**control structures**, and they are present *everywhere* in real programs.
We'll look at their formal definitions and more examples of their use here, as
they'll let us write much more powerful, useful programs and perform more
complex analyses.
