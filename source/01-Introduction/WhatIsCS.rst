What is Computer Science?
-------------------------

With an understanding of computers and programming, we can now turn our
attention to **computer science**, often abbreviated to **CS**.  Your first
thought might be "surely that is the study of computers!  We can study how they
work, how they are made, ..."

While that describes part of the field of computer science, it is a relatively
small part.  More broadly, CS is the study of **what we can do with
computers**.  Computer scientists use computers and programming to solve
problems, and they are constantly using them to solve new problems or finding
better solutions than those previously discovered.
