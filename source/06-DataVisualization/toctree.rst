Data Visualization
==================

Now that we have some fundamental programming tools that we can apply to data
science, we can start looking at some fundamentals of data science itself.  The
first thing we will look at here is data visualization, which is a cornerstone
of analyzing or processing any data.  Visualization allows you to better
understand the data you are dealing with, provides a way to check the results
of your analysis for correctness, and is often the most effective tool for
*communicating* your analysis to others as well.

In this chapter, we'll start with the basics of visualization as a tool, then
get into how to create visualizations of data in Python.
